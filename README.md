This repo will a hold a few small tools that can be hosted on github pages and run across multiple devices.

## Live Demos
- **[Posthog Replay Fixer](https://nmolinatcv.github.io/sandbox/posthog-replay-fixer/index.html)**  
    Older Posthog Session Replays point to expired CDN files. Super simple site where you can upload an exported replay, update the cdn calls, and export the modified replay. Also let's you view the replay on the site.

- **[Chrome Desktop Checker](https://nmolinatcv.github.io/sandbox/chrome-desktop-checker/index.html)**  
    Tool for checking whether or not the client is a chrome desktop. Simply checks if the extension runtime is available. Mobile devices do not have access to the chrome.runtime.

- **[Keypress Checker](https://nmolinatcv.github.io/sandbox/keypress-checker/index.html)**  
    Tool for checking what buttons were pressed.
